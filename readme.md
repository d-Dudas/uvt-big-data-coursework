# Big Data Coursework

## Requierements

### Main goal

Solve a real-life problem using a dataset and demonstrate Big Data principles,  
following the CRISP-DM lifecycle.

### CRISP-DM Lifecycle Overview

1. **Business Understanding**: What real-world problem are you trying to solve?
2. **Data Understanding**: Explore BETH dataset: What's in it? What could it  
   help solve?
3. **Data Preparation**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis (handle  
   missing values, standardize formats, etc).
4. **Modeling**: Use machine learning or analytics to find patterns or make  
   predictions.
5. **Evaluation**: Test your results and check if they solve the problem.
6. **Deployment**: A report or presentation to share your findings and  
   solutions.

### Deliverables

- 60% of the grade -> 5-minute presentation
  - present the problem, it's relevance, the dataset, any legal/ethical
    concerns (LSEPI = Legal, Social, Ethical, Privacy, and Intellectual
    property), and your CRISP-DM process.
- 40% of the grade -> 5-minute code demo
  - show the code, run it live, explain a technical challange you overcome
